There are some dll specific moudules of each platform

so download neel.py and .pyd file

python 3.11 must be installed on your windows machine

execute pip install -r a.txt

then pip install pyinstaller

finally pyinstaller --onefile neel.py

Script mode is more efficient than exe version

enjoy !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Donot have the audacity to change anything
